                    Orientation is important because it lays a foundation for the new student's entire career
                    with the school.
                    First impressions are important since they establish the basis for everything that follows.
                    Without orientation, a new
                    student sometimes feels uncomfortable in his/her new environment and takes longer to reach
                    his/her full potential.

                    My orientation week at <a href="https://www.refactory.ug/" target="_blank">Refactory</a> was
                    awesome. It was
                    held via <strong>Zoom</strong>. I had the opportunity to meet with different facilitators,
                    alumnis and friends.
                    My expectations were made clear and objectives of the program were all clarified.

                <p class="card-text lead">
                    I was also introduced to the tools that we were going to using during the program. Tools covered
                    include <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> ( a text
                    editor), <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git</a> (A version
                    control
                    tool).
