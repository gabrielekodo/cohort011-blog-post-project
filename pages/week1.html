                    It's often said that a jorney of a thousand miles begins with a step. Here
                    is my story.

                    The <strong>Software Engineering Program </strong> at <a href="https://www.refactory.ug/"
                        target="_blank">Refactory</a> is a very fast-paced plan. Each single has a specific topic to
                    be
                    covered.
                    My very first lecture was an introduction to how the <strong>Internet</strong> works where I was
                    introduced to concepts such as computer networking, servers, domain names, IP Addresses, TCP/IP
                    protocols.

                <p class="card-text lead">
                    Day Two was mainly about Software design processes and steps which includes Budgetting, creating
                    a
                    team,choosing the tools to be used for the project e.g project management tools, the programming
                    language, frameworks etc, the development process(e.g agile development).
                </p>
                <p class="card-text lead">
                    Day Three was introduction to version control systems. We were introduced to
                    <strong>Git</strong>
                    and <strong>Github</strong>. I learnt about the different commands used in git CLI such
                    <code>git add, git commit, git push, git remote, git pull</code>
                    I learnt how to create a repository locally and remotely. I learnt how to create an online
                    repository on Github and both push and pull to and from it.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text lead">
                    On the fourth day I was introduced to HTML(a markup language used to build websites).
                    I learnt about different element selectors used for varying purposes.

                    The fifth day was an introduction to CSS.
                    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
                    CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
                    CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
